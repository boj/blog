      <description>Efficient Note Taking As my company starts belatedly revamping our corporate structure a lot of things have been changing, including my personal spiral towards a manager schedule vs a maker schedule lately. One thing I have noticed as I track more and more disparate things is that if I don&amp;rsquo;t start taking better notes now I&amp;rsquo;m going to fall behind and drown in forgotten caveats sooner than later. The less effective I am at tracking what I need to do (outside of task based work), or need to know across a breadth of projects, people, and responsibilities, the less effective I am going to be at supporting my team.</description>
